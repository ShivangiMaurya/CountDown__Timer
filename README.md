# Countdown Timer ðŸš€

This is a countdown timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer allows users to select a future date and time, then countdown to it. It also features a 
beautiful gradient effect applied to the text and various advanced CSS styles for a modern and engaging user interface.

## Features
- Real-time countdown to a selected date and time.
- Gradient text effect on the heading for a vibrant and stylish look.
- Hover effects and smooth animations for interactive UI.
- Shadow effects for text and timer elements.

## How it works

The countdown timer will show you how much time is remaining until the future date and time that you select.
  
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how it works:

- You select a future date and time using the input field.
- When you click the Start Countdown button, the timer starts counting down.
- The timer will continuously update every second and display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Once the countdown reaches zero, the timer stops, and an alert is shown: "Countdown finished!"

## For Example:
If you select January 20, 2025, 12:00 PM and start the countdown on January 19, 2025, the timer will show something like:
00 days : 23 hours : 59 minutes : 30 seconds (if you started it 30 seconds before the target time).
When the countdown reaches 00:00:00:00, it will show the alert "Countdown finished!".
